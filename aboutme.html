    <h3>So, who am I?</h3>
    <p>Well, I am 16 years old. I attend Hillcrest Highschool in California. My favorite school subject is writing and science.
    I want to study psychology and become an occupational therapist. Why, you may ask? I truly enjoy helping others and understanding
    the process of the brain. I'm not very popular, but am considered well-known in my class. I'd like to say I'm a friendly and 
    welcoming person. This year I have really picked up myself and have become very confident. As silly as it may sound to those who
    do not know we well, it is all thanks to my favorite human, Dan. More about him and Phil later though! I've lived in California 
    since I was born but have traveled outside of the country and thoughout the country many times. I've traveled to Arizona, Nevada, 
    Hawaii, France, Turkey, and my home country, Lebanon.</p>
